# PowerShell Script Encoding Fix

## Issue
The `deploy-infrastructure-cli.ps1` script had encoding issues with Unicode characters (emojis) that caused PowerShell parsing errors:

```
Missing argument in parameter list.
The string is missing the terminator: ".
Missing closing '}' in statement block or type definition.
```

## Root Cause
PowerShell scripts with UTF-8 BOM encoding can have issues with Unicode emoji characters:
- ✅ (checkmark emoji)
- 🚀 (rocket emoji)  
- 🌐 (globe emoji)
- 🗄️ (database emoji)
- 📊 (chart emoji)
- 🔧 (wrench emoji)
- ❌ (cross mark emoji)

These characters can be misinterpreted by PowerShell, causing parse errors.

## Solution
Replaced all Unicode emojis with:
1. **ASCII-safe text** with **colored output** using `-ForegroundColor`
2. Plain ASCII characters only

## Changes Made

### Before (with emojis):
```powershell
Write-Host "🚀 Deploying Reactivities Infrastructure (Azure CLI)"
Write-Host "✅ Logged in as: $($account.user.name)"
Write-Host "✅ Resource group ready"
Write-Host "✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!"
Write-Host "🌐 Application URLs:"
Write-Host "🗄️ Database:"
Write-Host "📊 Monitoring:"
Write-Host "🔧 Next Steps:"
Write-Error "❌ Deployment failed!"
```

### After (ASCII with colors):
```powershell
Write-Host "Deploying Infrastructure (Azure CLI)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Logged in as: $($account.user.name)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Resource group ready" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Application URLs:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Database:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Monitoring:" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "Next Steps:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "Deployment failed!" -ForegroundColor Red
```

## Color Mapping

| Original Emoji | Color Used | Purpose |
|----------------|------------|---------|
| 🚀 (rocket) | Cyan | Headers |
| ✅ (checkmark) | Green | Success messages |
| 🌐🗄️📊 (icons) | Cyan | Section headers |
| 🔧 (wrench) | Yellow | Next steps |
| ❌ (cross) | Red | Errors |

## Result
✅ Script now parses correctly in PowerShell
✅ Output is still colorful and readable
✅ No encoding issues
✅ Works across different PowerShell versions and encodings

## Verification
```powershell
# Check syntax
Get-Command .\deploy-infrastructure-cli.ps1 -Syntax

# Output:
# deploy-infrastructure-cli.ps1 [[-ResourceGroupName] <string>] [[-Location] <string>] [[-Prefix] <string>] [[-AppServicePlanSku] <string>] [[-SqlAdminPassword] <securestring>] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## Best Practice for PowerShell Scripts

**Avoid Unicode emojis in PowerShell scripts:**
- ❌ Don't use: `Write-Host "✅ Success"`
- ✅ Do use: `Write-Host "Success" -ForegroundColor Green`

**Why?**
- PowerShell encoding can vary across systems
- Different terminals render Unicode differently
- Some CI/CD systems don't support Unicode
- ASCII + colors works everywhere

## Testing
To verify the script works:

```powershell
# Dry run - just check syntax
Get-Command .\deploy-infrastructure-cli.ps1

# Real run (will prompt for SQL password)
.\deploy-infrastructure-cli.ps1
```

**The script is now fixed and ready to use!** 🎉 (okay, one emoji in the docs is fine! 😄)
