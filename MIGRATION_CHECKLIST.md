## Deployment Testing Checklist

### 1. Test ARM Template Deployment

```powershell
# Deploy infrastructure
.\deploy-infrastructure-cli.ps1 `
  -ResourceGroupName "test-windows-rg" `
  -AppNamePrefix "testwin" `
  -SqlAdminPassword "TestPass123!"
```

- [ ] Deployment completes without errors
- [ ] Resource group created
- [ ] App Service Plan created
- [ ] API App Service created
- [ ] BFF App Service created
- [ ] SQL Server created
- [ ] SQL Database created
- [ ] Application Insights created

### 2. Verify Windows Configuration

```powershell
# Check App Service Plan OS
az appservice plan show `
  --name testwin-plan `
  --resource-group test-windows-rg `
  --query "[kind, reserved]"
```

- [ ] Expected output: `["app", false]` or `["windows", false]`

```powershell
# Check API runtime
az webapp config show `
  --name testwin-api `
  --resource-group test-windows-rg `
  --query "netFrameworkVersion"
```

- [ ] Expected output: `"v9.0"`

```powershell
# Check BFF runtime
az webapp config show `
  --name testwin-bff `
  --resource-group test-windows-rg `
  --query "netFrameworkVersion"
```

- [ ] Expected output: `"v9.0"`

### 3. Deploy API Application

```powershell
# Build and publish API
dotnet publish API/API.csproj -c Release -o ./publish/api

# Deploy to Azure
az webapp deploy `
  --resource-group test-windows-rg `
  --name testwin-api `
  --src-path ./publish/api `
  --type zip
```

- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Deployment completes successfully
- [ ] App starts without errors
- [ ] Health check passes

```powershell
# Test API endpoint
curl https://testwin-api.azurewebsites.net/api/activities
```

- [ ] Returns 200 OK or expected response

### 4. Deploy BFF Application

```powershell
# Build React
cd client
npm install
npm run build
cd ..

# Build and publish BFF
dotnet publish BFF/BFF.csproj -c Release -o ./publish/bff

# Deploy to Azure
az webapp deploy `
  --resource-group test-windows-rg `
  --name testwin-bff `
  --src-path ./publish/bff `
  --type zip
```

- [ ] React build completes successfully
- [ ] BFF build completes successfully
- [ ] Deployment completes successfully
- [ ] App starts without errors

```powershell
# Test BFF endpoint
Start-Process https://testwin-bff.azurewebsites.net
```

- [ ] Frontend loads successfully
- [ ] React app displays
- [ ] No console errors

### 5. Verify Application Functionality

- [ ] Frontend loads in browser
- [ ] Can view activities
- [ ] Can create new activity
- [ ] Can edit activity
- [ ] Can delete activity
- [ ] User authentication works
- [ ] SignalR comments work
- [ ] Image upload works (if configured)

### 6. Check Monitoring

```powershell
# View logs
az webapp log tail --resource-group test-windows-rg --name testwin-api
az webapp log tail --resource-group test-windows-rg --name testwin-bff
```

- [ ] No critical errors in logs
- [ ] Application Insights collecting data
