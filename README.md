# Reactivities Project Repository

Welcome to the brand new version of the Reactivities app created for the Udemy training course available [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react).

This has been rewritten from scratch to take advantage of and to make it (hopefully) a bit more futureproof.  This app is built using .Net 9 and React 19

# Running the project

You can see a live demo of this project [here](https://reactivities-course.azurewebsites.net/).

To get into the app you will need to sign up with a valid email account or just use GitHub login as email verification is part of the app functionality in the published version of the app.   

You can also run this app locally.  The easiest way to do this without needing a database server is to use the version of the app before publishing which does not require a valid email address or Sql Server.  Most of the functionality will work except for the photo upload which would require you to sign up to Cloudinary (free) and use your own API keys here.  You need to have the following installed on your computer for this to work:

1. .Net SDK v9
2. NodeJS (at least version 18+ or 20+)
3. git (to be able to clone the project repo)

Once you have these then you can do the following: 
1. Clone the project in a User folder on your computer by running:

```bash
# you will of course need git installed to run this
git clone https://github.com/TryCatchLearn/Reactivities.git
cd Reactivities
```
2. Checkout a version of the project that uses Sqlite and does not require email confirmation:
```bash
git checkout 684e26a
```
3. Restore the packages by running:

```bash
# From the solution folder (Reactivities)
dotnet restore

# Change directory to client to run the npm install.  Only necessary if you want to run
# the react app in development mode using the Vite dev server
cd client
npm install
```

4. If you wish for the photo upload to work create a file called appsettings.json in the Reactivities/API folder and copy/paste the following configuration.

```json
{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Information",
      "Microsoft.AspNetCore": "Warning"
    }
  },
  "CloudinarySettings": {
    "CloudName": "REPLACEME",
    "ApiKey": "REPLACEME",
    "ApiSecret": "REPLACEME"
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*"
}
```
5. Create an account (free of charge, no credit card required) at https://cloudinary.com and then replace the Cloudinary keys in the appsettings.json file with your own cloudinary keys.

6. You can then run the app and browse to it locally by running:

```bash
# run this from the API folder in one terminal/command prompt
cd API
dotnet run

# open another terminal/command prompt tab and run the following
cd client
npm run dev

```

7. You can then browse to the app on https://localhost:3000 and login with either of the test users:

    email: bob@test.com or tom@test.com or jane@test.com
    
    password: Pa$$w0rd
